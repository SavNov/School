Logic, Critical Thinking, and Reasoning

# Understanding Logic

- Logic involves the analysis and construction of arguments to determine their validity.
- It helps individuals distinguish between facts, opinions, and personal feelings.
- By applying logic, one can evaluate the soundness of reasoning and the strength of arguments.
    -> "Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end." - Spock

# Critical Thinking Principles

- Critical thinking requires suspending beliefs and judgments until all relevant facts are gathered and considered.
- It considers cultural systems, values, and beliefs to avoid biases and prejudices.
- This process opens up individuals to new ideas and perspectives, fostering intellectual growth.
    -> "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." - Albert Einstein

# Types of Reasoning

- Reasoning can be classified into inductive and deductive reasoning.
$ Deductive Reasoning: Involves drawing a specific conclusion from a general premise and a specific assertion.
    - Deductive reasoning follows the pattern that if A, B, and C are taken to be true, then logically it must follow that D is true.
$ Inductive reasoning involves making generalizations based on specific observations or evidence.
    - Inductive reasoning follows the pattern that if A, B, and C are true, then logically D may also be true.

# Type of Reasoning
