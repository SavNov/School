# Logic Notes
- Logical means that it follows from logic, and that the conclusion is true if we hold the premises to also be true.
- Knowledge refers to a clear awareness and understanding of something. 
    - You *Know* that water boils at 100 C. You *Know* that the sky is blue. These are facts that can be verified.
- Deductive Reasoning is when you start with a generalized statement or series of statements, and given the premises provided by a situation, apply it to that situation to arrive at a specific conclusion about the environment. This is Ti applying it's knowledgebase to a problem to determine what must be true.
- Inductive Reasoning is when you start with a specific statement or series of specific statements and use them to derive a generalized conclusion about the environment as whole, or a hypothesis.
- Critical Thinking is suspending beliefs and judgements until you have all the facts and consider them carefully. You don't want to drag your biases or existing knowledge into it. You want to consider the situation on its own terms.
- Claims are statements that haven't been vetted for their truthfulness yet. Any argument you haven't vetted is merely a claim, nothing more.
- Propositions are statements or opinions that are effectively assertions about what the truth is. These assertions can be debated and evaluated for their accuracy.
